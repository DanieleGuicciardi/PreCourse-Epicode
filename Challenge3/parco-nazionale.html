    <h1>Parco Nazionale D'Abruzzo</h1>
    <h3>Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise National Park (Italian: Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise) is an Italian national park established in 1923. The majority of the park is   located in the Abruzzo region, with smaller parts in Lazio and Molise. It is sometimes called by its former name Abruzzo National Park. The park headquarters are in Pescasseroli in the Province of L'Aquila. The park's area is 496.80 km2 (191.82 sq mi)</h3>

            <p>The idea for the Abruzzo National Park arose in the years following World War I thanks to the work of Erminio Sipari, environmentalist, member of Italian Parliament and cousin of Benedetto Croce.[2] Between the months of October and November 1921, the municipality of Opi leased 5 square kilometres of land to a private federation with the aim of protecting flora and fauna and Sipari founded in Rome an organization to administer the reserve.[3] So the Park was founded in September 1922.[4] Over the next few years the territory of the park expanded into neighbouring municipalities until it covered around 120 km2 by 1923, when protection was enshrined in law. A period of intense activity followed and the park had further expanded to around 300 km2 when it was abolished by the Fascist government in 1933.</p>
