    <h1>GranSasso</h1>
    <h3>Gran Sasso d'Italia (Italian: [ɡran ˈsasso diˈtaːlja]; lit. 'Great Rock of Italy') is a massif in the Apennine Mountains of Italy. Its highest peak, 
        Corno Grande 2,912 metres (9,554 ft), is the highest mountain in the Apennines, and the second-highest mountain in Italy outside the Alps. The mountain 
        lies within Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park.</h3>

            <p>The three main summits of the Gran Sasso are Corno Grande, which at 2,912 metres (9,554 feet) is the highest peak in the Apennines, nearby Corno Piccolo, and Pizzo d'Intermesoli, which is separated from the other two peaks by Val Maone, a deep valley. Corno Grande and Corno Piccolo's ash coloration come from their limestone and dolomite composition. The peaks are snow-covered for much of the year though the snow cover appears to be less each decade. Corno Piccolo is referred to as, "The Sleeping Giant". This is due to the appearance of a profile of a reclined face. This view of Corno Piccolo is evident when viewing the mountain from Pietracamela, a small town near Prati di Tivo, on the north side of the mountain. Corno Grande and Corno Piccolo with their rough vertical walls provide serious rock climbers with challenges.

                Situated below the peak of the Corno Grande is the Calderone glacier, although deglaciation has significantly reduced the glacier's size. Glaciologists now question whether the glacier will survive past 2020.</p>
