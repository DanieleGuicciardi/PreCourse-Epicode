    <h1>CAMPO IMPERATORE</h1>
    <h3>Campo Imperatore ("Emperor's Field") is a mountain grassland or alpine meadow formed by a high basin shaped plateau located above Gran Sasso massif, 
        the largest plateau of Apennine ridge. Known as "Little Tibet", it is located in Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park, near L'Aquila, Abruzzo, Italy.</h3>

            <p>Campo Imperatore is a tectonic origin shaped by alluviums and glaciers. The plateau, which is 27 km in length and an average of 8 km in width, lies adjacent to 
                the Apennines' highest peak Corno Grande, and Europe's southernmost glacier, the Calderone; also surrounding the plateau are Monte Prena, Monte Aquila, and the 
                Camicia Mountains to the north and Monte Scindarella, Mesola and Monte Bolza to the south.
                The plateau's altitude ranges from 1,500 to 1,900 meters. It covers an expanse of approximately 80 km2. Campo Imperatore is home to one of Italy's oldest 
                alpine ski resorts. Located on the plateau's western edge, the resort began commercial operation in the 1920s and continues to thrive as a ski resort to this
                day due to its proximity to Rome (132 km). The resort's hotel became dictator Benito Mussolini's prison in August 1943 with his fall from power until he was 
                freed by German commandos on 12 September 1943. On the eastern side of the plateau is a 4 km cross country ski trail, which is maintained by the nearby town 
                of Castel del Monte.</p>
